Although it is not wise to jump to conclusions, our budget for this UTRGV Software 
is very high (i.e. there should be no worry about the costs this program will incur)

Given the lack of information we have about the program we need to create,
we cannot determine the exact cost to validate the budget amount.

Note that the costs could be higher then intended due to changes that may need
to be done late in the development cycle. While we would like to avoid this scenario,
we must prepare for the worst case should it happen
